## Analysis Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To do this, New Yor City data from a bike-sharing service in the month of August was analyzed; looking at the number of bike trips for all riders and genders, length of time bikes are checked out, and the most popular day of the week and times bikes were used.

## Results
I created 9 different visulizations using tableau, which can be viewed here: [link to dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/arianna.topbjerg#!/vizhome/NYCBikesharingServiceAnalysis/NYCStory)
