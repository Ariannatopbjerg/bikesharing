## Analysis Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To do this, New Yor City data from a bike-sharing service in the month of August was analyzed; looking at the number of bike trips for all riders and genders, length of time bikes are checked out, and the most popular day of the week and times bikes were used.

## Results
I created 9 different visulizations using tableau, which can be viewed here: [link to dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/arianna.topbjerg#!/vizhome/NYCBikesharingServiceAnalysis/NYCStory)

### Findings:
- Total number of trips in August: 2,344,224
- There are 1.9 million subscribers and 443,865 customers.
- The majority of riders were male (65%). 
- The peek riding hours are between 5pm to 6pm.
- Most popular checkout time is 5 minutes.
- Thursday is the most popular day to ride.
- Male subscribers ride the most throughout a week.

## Summary
Since Des Moines is a urban city similar to New York City, transportation can be time consuming, especially using a car to get to your destination due to traffic. Since most things in a city is close together, having a more efficient and faster transportation system seems logical. 
Looking at the bike-sharing service data, about 1.9 million people are subscribers to the service and almost 500 thousand are customers. This shows that the service is fairly popular. The most popular times riders bike ride is between 5pm to 6pm. This can be due to people getting out of work. Also, since the data is from the month of August, days are lighter, longer, and warmer. This can lead to later bike rides. 
Overall, the data shows that a bike-sharing service would be a great idea for Des Moines and many other urban citys. What I would research more for this project, is number of rides in colder months and average trip distances. The analysis does show time per checkout of each bike, but I think it would be interesting to see how far a rider goes during their time. This will show if bike riding is a faster/beneficial transportation service.
